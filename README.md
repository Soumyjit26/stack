# Stack Implementation in C with User Input

This repository contains a basic implementation of a stack data structure in C programming language. The program allows users to perform stack operations like push, pop, and display elements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run this program, you need a C compiler. If you don't have one installed, you can download and install GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

### Compilation

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory containing the source code files.

Run the following command to compile the program:

```bash
gcc main.c -o stack
```

### Usage

After compilation, you'll have an executable file named `stack`. Run the program using the following command:

```bash
./stack
```

The program will guide you through the process of interacting with the stack. You can perform the following actions:

1. **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
2. **Pop**: Remove and display the top element from the stack.
3. **Display**: Display all the elements in the stack.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform these actions. You can input integers as elements to be pushed onto the stack.

## Example

Here's an example of how the program might work:

```
